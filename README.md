# Movie-Ratings-Prediction-in-R-
In this project we will learn how to predict movie ratings by using different algorithms in R Programming 
Character Encoding
The three data files are encoded as UTF-8. This is a departure from previous MovieLens data sets, which used different character encodings. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Mis√©rables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.

User Ids
Movielens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized.

Users were selected separately for inclusion in the ratings and tags data sets, which implies that user ids may appear in one set but not the other.

The anonymized values are consistent between the ratings and tags data files. That is, user id n, if it appears in both files, refers to the same real MovieLens user.

Ratings Data File Structure
All ratings are contained in the file ratings.dat. Each line of this file represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:

UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp

The lines within this file are ordered first by UserID, then, within user, by MovieID.

Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments.

Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

Tags Data File Structure
All tags are contained in the file tags.dat. Each line of this file represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:

UserID::MovieID::Tag::Timestamp

The lines within this file are ordered first by UserID, then, within user, by MovieID.

Tags are user generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word, or short phrase. The meaning, value and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.

Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

Movies Data File Structure
Movie information is contained in the file movies.dat. Each line of this file represents one movie, and has the following format:

MovieID::Title::Genres

MovieID is the real MovieLens id.

Movie titles, by policy, should be entered identically to those found in IMDB, including year of release. However, they are entered manually, so errors and inconsistencies may exist.

Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:

Action
Adventure
Animation
Children's
Comedy
Crime
Documentary
Drama
Fantasy
Film-Noir
Horror
Musical
Mystery
Romance
Sci-Fi
Thriller
War
Western
